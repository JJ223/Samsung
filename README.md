# Summary
The "Data-Driven Price and Delivery Time Optimization for a manufacturing company" project focuses on leveraging data analysis, modeling, and optimization techniques to enhance the operations of Filterbond, a well-established manufacturing company with over 25 years of industry experience. The primary objective of this project is to analyze budgets, production data, and historical records to create models that suggest optimal prices and estimated delivery times for each product. The ultimate goal is to streamline the production processes, increase efficiency, and improve overall profitability, with a particular focus on air filters, which can be both resold and manufactured in-house.

# Project Goals:

The project encompasses the following key objectives:

## 1 - Data Analysis and Preprocessing:
- Collect and clean historical budget and production data.
- Integrate various data sources to create a comprehensive dataset.
- Identify and address data quality issues, missing values, and outliers.

## 2 - Pricing Model Development:
- Develop data-driven pricing models to optimize the pricing strategy for products
- Utilize statistical analysis and machine learning to identify factors influencing pricing decisions, such as production costs, market demand, and competition.
- Incorporate dynamic pricing strategies that adapt to changing market conditions.

## 3 - Delivery Time Estimation:
- Build models for estimating the time to deliver products to customers.
- Consider various factors that affect delivery times, such as production lead times, inventory levels, and shipping logistics.
- Implement strategies for minimizing delivery times while ensuring cost-effectiveness.

## 4 - Monitoring and Feedback Loop:
- Establish a monitoring system to track the performance of pricing and delivery time models.
- Implement feedback loops to continuously adapt and refine pricing and production strategies based on real-time data and customer feedback.

# Data Utilization:

Utilize historical budget data, production records, cost information, and market data to inform pricing and delivery time models.
There will be two datasets, a budget (product description,quantity, price, customer) and production dataset (detailed product description, quantity)
